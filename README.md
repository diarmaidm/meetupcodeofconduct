Translations
------------

If you would like to contribute a translation to this project, please include a translated file that includes the language short code in the filename as this will be mapped to from the url. For example, fr.confcodeofconduct.com will load the `index-fr.html` file.

Fork this project, send a pull request and the translation will go live (though the translation may be validated before publishing).

Please check the [issues](https://github.com/c4rl/meetupcodeofconduct/issues) to see if anyone else is currently working on a translation.

Background
----------

This is forked from https://github.com/confcodeofconduct/confcodeofconduct.com to be specific to meetups, not conferences. See more info in that project's repo.

I'd like to continue using this as a simple go to reference for code of conduct for events I run - and equally events you run.

This is a public resource! For changes, please create a pull request, and if it makes sense, it'll be merged. :)

Hugs!
